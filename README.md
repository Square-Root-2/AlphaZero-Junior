# AlphaZero Junior
AlphaZero Junior is a small-scale reproduction of Deep Mind's AlphaZero, a program that achieved superhuman performance in the game of chess starting from random play and given no domain knowledge except the rules of the game. The code for AlphaZero Junior was adapted from the psuedocode in the supplementary materials of Deep Mind's paper [<em>A general reinforcement learning algorithm that masters chess, shogi and Go through self-play</em>](www.sciencemag.org/content/362/6419/1140/suppl/DC1).
